## General Behavior

Before starting any implementation or codebase exploration, ask the user what they want to focus on first. Do not autonomously explore or begin work without confirming the starting point.

## Language & Stack

This project primarily uses TypeScript and Rust. When generating code, default to TypeScript for frontend/API work and Rust for backend/systems work unless otherwise specified.

## Planning & Organization

When the user asks for planning, organization, or 'next steps', deliver a structured written response (numbered list or table) BEFORE reading additional files. Prioritize answering with what you already know, then fill gaps.
