# Ghostty colors - generated by wallust
# Source wallpaper: {{wallpaper}}
#
# Background color is NOT included here intentionally.
# Reason: To allow proper transparency control, background color is set
# in the main config file with background-opacity. If wallust sets the
# background here, it overrides opacity settings and results in a nearly
# opaque dark terminal regardless of the wallpaper.
#
# This file only contains: foreground, cursor, and palette colors.
